| `proto-limited` | removes all protos except for the ones required to decrypt the packets                                              |         |
| `proto-rqa`     | removes all protos that are not relevant for [reliquary-archiver](https://github.com/IceDynamix/reliquary-archiver) |         |

`proto-*` features depend on `network` and are mutually exclusive

## versioning

different package versions were made for different game versions. all game version updates will warrant breaking changes
in the generated protobuf types, hence the major version bumps.

| package version | game version |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `2.0.0`         | `2.3`        |
| `3.1.0`         | `2.4`        |
| `4.0.0`         | `2.5`        |
| `5.1.0`         | `2.6`        |
| `6.2.1`         | `2.7`        |
| `7.0.0`         | `3.0`        |
